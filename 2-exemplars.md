This chapter names and describes work related to the aforementioned design space. Most of the relevant work is ethnographic origin

Bicycling as a social practice has so far been covered by the humanities, especially by the social sciences.
While there also exist
many studies in the area of traffic research and urban planning, most of them
seem irrelevant to my research. Lastly, there is work in the areas of architecture
and design that touches on the design space that encompasses random vélomobile formations-in-action.



## Ethnographic study into Bicycling as Social practice

A prominent research project regarding the social practice of bicycling was taking place in four different UK cities as a joint effort of Rachel Aldred and Katrina Jungnickel [e.g. @jungnickel_cyclings_2014; @aldred2010; @aldred2012].
"Cycling Cultures", a multi-method sociological research project, yielded insights on cyclist identity, political aspects, and methodology [@jungnickel; @outthere].

## Designing for cycle-based interaction

While arguably most of the relevant literature regarding bicycling originates in the social sciences, there are some works within different areas of design that deal with bicycling or related concepts. 

Looking at bicycling and mobility, one can see many smartphone applications that aim to enhance the ride experience. While most of them are targeted towards professional and recreational bicycling (e.g. Strava, Map My Ride, Runtastic) and some towards (political) activism (e.g. Bikes vs. Cars, Charity Miles, Social Cyclist), it is hard to find examples that touch on sociality or serendipity in-action.

\todo[MORE HERE] @esbjornsson describe Hocman, a mobile application that fosters interaction between motorcyclists to complement random encounters on the road.
Hocman creates a virtual layer on top of the motorcycling community, which allows its members to enjoy each others sociability - however, not in situ.

\todo @cromwell approaches indirect social interaction between bicyclists (which include random vélomobile formations-in-action) from a perspective of landscape architecture, designing bicycle facilities to enhance the social experience of everyday bicycling.
Cromwell finds that a main aspect to keep in mind while designing for cycle-based interaction is *speed* and *time*. He concludes that, for social interaction to take place, upward slopes are actually good - because they decrease the maximum speed of any bicyclist, thus making the difference in cycling speed smaller and allowing people to stay close to each other for a longer period. 
As a landscape architect, Cromwell aims to shape the landscape in order to better the conditions for social interaction. His work gives opportunities, but does not enforce interactions that are unwanted. This is an important aspect, as we will learn in a later chapter that the readiness for social interaction is depending on culture (and other circumstances). Designing for cycle-based interaction must acknowledge this fact.

@rowland focus on interactive experiences for cyclists. By analysing two different experiences they derive eight lessons for designing cycle-based interaction: cycling proficiency, physicality, impact of the environment, media and hardware design, collaboration, and safety.
Although both of the examined interactive experiences are solitary, most of the lessons learned are relevant for this thesis as well. Furthermore, one can derive lessons of their own concerning sociability in bicycling.

@cheng focus on bicycling as a healthy physical activity. Previous research had shown that social peer effects enhance the exercise experience, but @-cheng have seen a lack of concrete design advice in this area. They subsequently suggest designs for enhanced bicycling gear, such as glasses, that convey the feeling of the co-presence of another cyclist. They identify factors that are relevant for and propose "an unobtrusive and unintuitive interface arrangement based on light" [@cheng].
