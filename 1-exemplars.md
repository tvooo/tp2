# Related work

This chapter names and describes exemplars regarding cycle-based interaction. As this thesis research aims to yield methodological knowledge, not only design artefacts are relevant related work exemplars, but also ethnographic and design research that enquires into the bicycling practice and, thus, shows the methodology currently used in such circumstances.

## Designing for cycle-based interaction

While arguably most of the relevant literature regarding bicycling originates in the social sciences, there are some works within different areas of design that deal with bicycling or related concepts. 

Looking at bicycling and mobility, one can see many smartphone applications that aim to enhance the ride experience. Most of them are targeted towards professional and recreational bicycling (e.g. Strava, Map My Ride, Runtastic) and some towards (political) activism (e.g. Bikes vs. Cars, Charity Miles, Social Cyclist). But all of these applications have in common that they do not require nor afford any interactivity. They either serve as a dashboard, mounted to the handlebars and used to get a glance of data like pace, distance, route, calories burned etc.; or they work on for themselves, sitting in the pocket of the cyclist for the duration of the ride. In both cases the interaction with the application is limited to starting and stopping an activity at the beginning and end of the ride, respectively. The cyclist does not engage with the application during the ride, nor does he engage with the environment or other cyclists *through* these applications during the ride. These apps are thus not good exemplars from an interaction design point-of-view.

@esbjornsson describe Hocman, a mobile application that fosters interaction between motorcyclists to complement random encounters on the road.
Hocman creates a virtual layer on top of the motorcycling community, which allows its members to enjoy each others sociability - however, not in situ. \todo[MORE HERE]

@cromwell approaches indirect social interaction between bicyclists (focusing on random vélomobile formations-in-action) from a perspective of landscape architecture. He proposes designs for bicycle facilities to enhance the social experience of everyday bicycling.
Cromwell finds that main aspects to keep in mind while designing for cycle-based interaction are *speed* and *time*. He concludes that, for social interaction to take place, upward slopes are actually good --- because they decrease the maximum speed of any bicyclist, thus making the difference in cycling speed smaller and allowing people to stay close to each other for a longer period. And the longer two people stay in proximity, the more room for interaction exists. 
As a landscape architect, Cromwell aims to shape the landscape in order to better the conditions for social interaction. His work gives opportunities, but does not enforce interactions that are unwanted. This is an important aspect, as we will learn in a later chapter that the willingness for social interaction is depending on culture (and other circumstances). Designing for cycle-based interaction must acknowledge this.

@rowland focus on interactive experiences for cyclists. By analysing two different experiences they derive eight factors that are relevant for designing cycle-based interaction: cycling proficiency, physicality, impact of the environment, media and hardware design, collaboration, and safety.
Although @rowland focus on interactive experiences, their learnings are relevant for many kinds of cycle-based interactions.

@cheng focus on bicycling as exercise. Previous research had shown that social peer effects enhance the exercise experience, but Cheng et al. have seen a lack of concrete design advice in this area. They subsequently suggest designs for enhanced bicycling gear, such as glasses, that convey the feeling of the co-presence of another, remote cyclist. They identify factors that are relevant for and propose "an unobtrusive and intuitive interface arrangement based on light". 

## Ethnographic studies into Bicycling as Social practice

Ethnographic studies into the practice of bicycling have been conducted by researchers with many different foci. The following three examples constitute recent research that either include reflection on the methodology that has been used, or document the used methodology detailed enough to allow an examination 'from the outside'.

### Cycling Cultures

A prominent research project regarding the social practice of bicycling was taking place in four different UK cities as a joint effort of Rachel Aldred and Katrina Jungnickel [e.g. @jungnickel_cyclings_2014; @aldred2010; @aldred2012]. "Cycling Cultures", a multi-method sociological research project, yielded insights on how cycling is practised, experienced, and represented in different localities. Findings also highlighted sociopolitical aspects.

\todo[Go more into detail with the different papers of Jungnickel and Aldred]

Part of the outcomes of this study was also Jungnickel's reflection on methodology used, in particular videography [@jungnickel, @outthere].

### Mobile place-making

@spinney, through an ethnographic narrative, tells the story of an imaginary bicycle ride through London. In this, he focuses on 
Spinney's narrative is based on interviews and ethnographic field work, specifically through video recordings.

In other work, Spinney discusses the use of Mobile Video Ethnography in cycling research.

### Cycling and talking together

@mcilvenny analyses the \velo (see chapter \ref{theoretical-framework}) that two bicyclists create in order to sustain a conversation. His analyses makes use of video recordings and transcribed conversations. Multiple cameras are mounted in different angles from the participants' point-of-view.

The focus in McIlvenny's work lies on the relationship between the participants, how they act as a group and expose their being-a-group. It is not so much focused on the relationship between the participants and other actors (such as other road users or the environment). McIlvenny analyses the video recordings along with the conversation, by transcribing individual moves of the cyclists (e.g. *"H pulls up to the red traffic lights"*) together with the spoken words. While other actors are mentioned (*"a pedestrian is walking on the cycle path up ahead"*), they are only treated as triggers to switch into different \velo (*"Lyn moves ahead into single file formation"*).

## Mapping the Design Space

This chapter takes a look back at the exemplars and maps them out according to a set of different parameters. Subsequently, I identify gaps in the design space and explain how microinteractions in chance encounters and vélomobile formations-in-action fit into the space.

\todo[Make it pretty, structured, visual]

### Parameters

- Context / cyclists' goal (e.g. exercise, commute, experience, flaneurial)
- In motion / not in motion
- Place (road, bicycle path, stop light, crossing, parking, ...)
- Target of interaction (environment, other nearby cyclist/road user, remote person)
- Situation (passing someone/-thing, being passed, riding together, riding alone, ...)
- Explicitness/directness of interaction
- Environmental factors (noise, nature/concrete, motor traffic, time of day...)
- Artefact, if any

### Exemplars & parameters

\todo[way to do...]

@cheng

- Context: exercise
- In motion
- Artefact: bicycling gear/clothing
- Place: road
- Target of interaction: remote cyclist, co-presence, known
- Situation: irrelevant/always
- Indirect, but explicit

@rowland

- Context: interactive experience / art
- Exploration: in motion; Interaction: not in motion
- Artefact: phone
- Place: anywhere/not relevant
- Target of interaction: environment

\todo[Here are actually two experiences that map slightly different!]
