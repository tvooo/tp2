# Related work

This chapter describes related work from in the area of cycle-based interaction. As this thesis research aims to yield methodological knowledge, not only design artefacts are relevant as exemplars, but also ethnographic and design research that enquires into the bicycling practice and, thus, shows the methodology currently used in such circumstances.

## Designing for cycle-based interaction

While arguably most of the relevant literature regarding bicycling originates in the social sciences, there are some works within different areas of design that deal with bicycling or related concepts. 

There are many smartphone applications that aim to enhance or complement the bicycling experience. Most of them are targeted towards professional and recreational bicycling (e.g. Strava, Map My Ride, Runtastic) and some towards (political) activism (e.g. Bikes vs. Cars, Charity Miles, Social Cyclist). But all of these applications have in common that they do not require nor afford any interactivity during the ride. They either serve as a dashboard, mounted to the handlebars and used to get a glance of data like pace, distance, route, calories burned etc.; or they work for themselves, sitting in the pocket of the cyclist for the duration of the ride. In both cases the interaction with the application is limited to starting and stopping an activity at the beginning and end of the ride, respectively. The cyclist does not engage with the application during the ride, nor does he engage with the environment or other cyclists *through* it during the ride. These applications are thus not good exemplars from an interaction design point-of-view.

@esbjornsson describe Hocman, a mobile application that fosters interaction between motorcyclists to complement random encounters on the road.
Hocman creates a virtual layer on top of the motorcycling community, which allows its members to enjoy each others sociability - however, not in situ. Users can create a hypertext page about them and their motorcycle; e.g. preferred routes, motorcycle model, and applied tunings. This page is then uploaded onto a device they carry during the motorcycle ride. Whenever they pass a motorcyclist using Hocman in some distance, they exchange their respective pages. This way, the motorcyclists' engagement with each other can be deepened and extended --- to find others with similar interests, appreciate each others motorcycle, and even meet up for a ride.

@cromwell approaches indirect social interaction between bicyclists from the perspective of landscape architecture. He proposes designs for bicycle facilities to enhance the social experience of everyday bicycling.
Cromwell finds that main aspects to keep in mind while designing for cycle-based interaction are *speed* and *time*. He concludes that, for social interaction to take place, upward slopes are actually good --- because they decrease the maximum speed of any bicyclist, thus lowering the cyclists' speed differential and allowing people to stay close to each other for a longer period. The longer two people stay in proximity, the more room for interaction exists. 
As a landscape architect, Cromwell aims to shape the landscape in order to better the conditions for social interaction. His work gives opportunities, but does not enforce interactions that are unwanted. This is an important aspect, as we will learn in a later chapter that the willingness for social interaction is depending on culture (and other circumstances). Designing for cycle-based interaction must acknowledge this.

@rowland focus on interactive experiences for cyclists. By analysing two different experiences they derive eight factors that are relevant for designing cycle-based interaction:

- Cycling skill varies greatly
- Cycling is a demanding physical activity
- Cyclists have a close connection with the environment
- Cyclists can cover wide areas
- Digital media must adapt to cycling
- Hardware interfaces must be carefully integrated into the overall bike hardware
- Cycling limits social interaction
- Safety matters

Although Rowland et al. analysed interactive *experiences*, their learnings are relevant for many kinds of cycle-based interaction, especially if additional artefacts are involved.

@cheng focus on bicycling as exercise. Previous research had shown that social peer effects enhance the exercise experience, but Cheng et al. have seen a lack of concrete design advice in this area. They subsequently suggest designs for enhanced bicycling gear, such as glasses, that convey the feeling of the co-presence of another, remote cyclist. They identify factors that are relevant for and propose "an unobtrusive and intuitive interface arrangement based on light". 

## Ethnographic studies into Bicycling as Social practice

Ethnographic studies into the practice of bicycling have been conducted by researchers with many different foci. The following three examples constitute recent research that either includes reflection on the methodology that has been used, or document the used methodology detailed enough to allow an examination 'from the outside'. As my research work aims to explore the methodological space, the methods applied by other researchers are an important reference.

### Cycling Cultures

A prominent research project regarding the social practice of bicycling was taking place in four different UK cities as a joint effort of Rachel Aldred and Katrina Jungnickel [e.g. @jungnickel_cyclings_2014; @aldred2010; @aldred2012]. "Cycling Cultures", a multi-method sociological research project at the University of East London, yielded insights on how cycling is practised, experienced, and represented in different localities. The researchers accompanied many single and group rides over the course of two years. @aldred2010 examines how, in a heavily-motorised country, cyclists define themselves as citizens in relation to their natural and social environments. @aldred2012 analyse how rhythm, positioning, and communication in group rides lead to the creation of mobile places. And in @jungnickel_cyclings_2014 they look into how cyclists manage their expose to the environment using audio devices. Other articles also highlighted sociopolitical aspects.

Part of the outcomes of this study was also Jungnickel's reflection on methodology used, in particular videography and photography. In @jungnickel, she describes how a time-lapse video can help represent the bicycling experience with all its "Jumps, Stutters, Blurs and Other Failed Images". In @outthere, she describes how she employed portrait photography to convey the *out there-ness* that cyclists experience --- having the view 'from the saddle' as opposed to a view framed by a car window. While photography is not in focus of this thesis, Jungnickel's work on time-lapse videography is adapted in the pilot experiment (see chapter \ref{experiments}).

### Mobile place-making

@spinney, through an ethnographic narrative, tells the story of an imaginary bicycle ride through London. In this, he examines on how apparently dull places, such as certain roundabouts or underpasses, have meaning for cyclists and thus become *places*. Spinney's research opposes Marc Augé's assumption that spaces of transition and mobility are non-places. Certain places lead to different route choices for different cyclists; for example, one cyclist might avoid a multi-lane, busy roundabout for reasons of safety, while another likes the challenge and sensation of 'flowing' between different cars and the opportunity to ride fast with the traffic.

In other work [-@spinney2011], Spinney discusses three different ways to use mobile video ethnography in cycling research: "video as a way of 'feeling there' when you can't be there; video as a way of apprehending fleeting moments of mobile experience; and video as a tool to extend sensory vocabularies."

### Cycling and talking together

@mcilvenny analyses different vélomobile formations-in-action (see chapter \ref{theoretical-framework}) that two bicyclists create in order to sustain a conversation. His analysis makes use of video recordings and transcribed conversations. Multiple cameras are mounted in different angles from the participants' point-of-view.

The focus in McIlvenny's work lies on the relationship between the participants, how they act as a group and expose their being-a-group. It is not so much focused on the relationship between the participants and other actors (such as other road users or the environment), but more on the internal relationship. McIlvenny analyses the video recordings along with the conversation, by transcribing individual moves of the cyclists (e.g. *"H pulls up to the red traffic lights"*) together with the spoken words. While other actors are mentioned (*"a pedestrian is walking on the cycle path up ahead"*), they are only treated as triggers to switch into different \velo (*"Lyn moves ahead into single file formation"*).
