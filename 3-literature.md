# Theoretical Framework

This chapter \todo[introduces] theoretical concepts that build the groundwork of this thesis. As I focus on social interaction, it \todo[is imperative] to explore the theory of social relations, with special focus on mobility. Secondly, I look into the social creation of meaning, which leads to place-making. Lastly, this chapter introduces *random vélobmobile formations-in-action*, which are one situation where cycle-based interaction can take place, and are in the focus of this research.

## 'with'

Erving Goffman studied peoples' relations in the public [-@goffman]. He came to the conclusion that social interaction in the public takes either place alone or in a group. He dubbed these two modes **single** and **with**, respectively. @jensen transfers Goffman's 'with' to the realm of mobility. He also acknowledges the ephemerality of such **'mobile withs'**:
> “[I]n the mundane and ordinary everyday life we make multiple ‘temporary congregations’ as we are slipping in and out of different ‘mobile withs’ ... ‘Mobile withs’ might be exemplified by groups of recreational runners or cyclists” [-@jensen, p. 341].

vélomobile formations-in-action:
  ~  @mcilvenny describes formations that bicyclists can assume in order to sustain a conversation. McIlvenny captures "different vélomobile formations-in-action" using video recordings and analyses them, creating a portfolio of different formations used to sustain social interaction between two or more people on bikes. His notion of *vélomobile formations-in-action* build a solid base for the description of the phenomenon that this research proposal addresses.^[It is important to note here that 'vélomobile' does not refer to the vehicle of the same name (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velomobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velomobile)), but rather to the concept of *being mobile using a bicycle* (rather than a different vehicle).]

## Place-making and purpose

As bicycling is a form of transportation, the movement within space and the concept of *place* play an important role. @dourish note that "a place is a space which is invested with understandings of behavioural appropriateness, cultural expectations, and so forth" and that places are "spaces that are valued". A place is made by associating meaning with a space, but what does this mean when you are mobile (and thus moving within space constantly)?

Marc Augé coined the term 'non-place' and used it to describe spaces of transition and mobility, for example bus stops and motorways. They are places "where interactions are structured by rules not defined by the people in them" [@spinney2007]. Augé argues that "we do not find these spaces meaningful", due to their nature of fleetingness, temporality and ephemerality. Spinney opposes this assumption with respect to bicycling, as cyclists engage with their socio-urban environment in an embodied and sensory way. He offers an account of meaningful embodied experiences of non-place by means of a narrative of an imaginary bicycle ride through London. \todo[Other accounts affirm the view that bicycle transport is indeed different from non-place.]

While Spinney focuses on the solitary embodied experience of bicycling, @mcilvenny describes formations that bicyclists can assume in order to sustain a conversation. His work is based on Jensen's [-@jensen] 'mobile with' --- a transfer of Erving Goffman's concept of 'single' and 'with' into the realm of mobility. Jensen argues that “in the mundane and
ordinary everyday life we make multiple ‘temporary congregations’ as we are slipping in and out
of different ‘mobile withs’ ... ‘Mobile withs’ might be exemplified by groups of recreational
runners or cyclists” [-@jensen, p. 341]. McIlvenny captures "different vélomobile formations-in-action" using video recordings and analyses them, creating a portfolio of different formations used to sustain social interaction between two or more people on bikes. His notion of *vélomobile formations-in-action* build a solid base for the description of the phenomenon that this research proposal addresses. Within this framework of 'mobile with', indirect interaction and formations-in-action exists an interaction design space that is largely unexplored.


Promising seems also the notion of transferring the *flaneur* to the world of bicycling. It is approached most prominently by @flaneur, but is also adapted by @esbjornsson to motorcycling.





## Chance encounters & vélomobile formations-in-action


<!--"Communication technologies,
like physical places, create structures which include and
exclude participants, and in so doing they can create
social boundaries equivalent to the walls and windows
in physical space. These boundaries define the nature
of social access to situations, and also help to frame an
awareness among individuals of whether an encounter
is accessible to them or not. Put simply this affects
whether they feel welcome, and can clearly identify and
develop a role for themselves and others in the
interaction, a factor which is often necessarily based on
existing social conventions with clearly differentiated
roles." - shared encounters-->

\todo[How does the literature lead to random velomobile formations-in-action?

In focus of my research work are *random vélomobile formations-in-action* in urban bicycle traffic. Paul McIlvenny describes vélomobile formations-in-action as "specific arrangements of bodies on
bikes and configurations of a 'vélomobile with'" [-@mcilvenny]. His work focuses on two or more people on bikes *intentionally* riding together and trying to maintain a conversation. In *random* vélomobile formations-in-action, however, this intentionality is missing. Rather, these formations describe temporary arrangements of bikes and people who are most likely strangers, and just happen to ride together at the same time, at a similar pace, for part of their respective journeys. This phenomenon occurs frequently in urban bicycle traffic, yet we seldom make note of it. The following imaginary narrative describes an instance of the phenomenon:

> Johan's commute leads him from Rönneholm in Malmö to the city's university in the western harbour. Early in this journey, he passes in front of the city library on Kung Oscars väg and turns left onto Slottsgatan, which immediately overpasses Fersens bro, a slightly ascending canal bridge. While taking the left turn, Johan moves into traffic next to Marie, who was approaching from his right. At this spot, the bike lane is wide enough for the two to ride side-by-side. As they are ascending Fersens bro, they maintain more or less the same pace and stay next to each other. After the climax, the bike lane narrows down. Johan sprints forward in order to slip in the front of Marie, making space for oncoming cyclists riding into the opposite direction. They continue to ride in a formation (in line, "singled up") until Marie turns right towards Stortorget.

\todo[Provide illustration/map here]

During their time on Fersens bro and after, Johan and Marie are in a 'vélomobile with' and form a random vélomobile formation-in-action. They negotiate their formation with respect to each others cycling abilities and the current environment, without having met each other before.

My research will be an exploration into the possibilities this phenomenon affords and can be distilled into two major questions:

1. How can we design for social interaction to take place during random encounters of bicyclists in vélomobile formations-in-action? How can this (neutral) randomness be turned into (pleasant) serendipity?
2. How can random vélomobile formations-in-action be constructively presented in order to convey a richer account of their experience?

These questions are to be approached using the following objectives:

- Describe the phenomenon at hand using both ethnographic as well as phenomenological accounts
- Explore design openings that exploit the phenomenon
- Create and execute design experiments that raise interaction design knowledge regarding the phenomenon
