# Representing the bicycling experience

Musings on cadence and methodology by *Tim von Oldenburg*

* * *

## Context - Bicycling

## Design Exemplars


### Industry

### Academia

## How do we know what do design for?

### Questionnaire, Interviews and other accidents

### Representations

-> Suchman's quote

## Video Ethnography

### How are we doing it now?
  Go-along: place the researcher alongside the participant in the context of doing of mobility

- Representations
- Interaction Analysis
- Spinney's three things

Video ethnography: because it would be difficult, unsafe, disruptive otherwise
-> i am so disruptive

## Process / Experimental / Programmatic-adjacent

## Video experiments

- show video

## Audio?

## Map

## Outlook and stuff

How can we but PANAS on the bicycle?

bio-sensing: GPS-enabled EEG sensors (brain activity) and GSR sensors (sweat level?), bodily data in a quantitative form, no subjectivism

## Notes

How do we research and represent the fleeting, unconscious and mobile? mobilities turn, "mobile methods"

mobile methods generally describe any attempt to physically or metaphori-
cally follow people/objects/ideas in order to support analysis of the experience/content/doing of,
and inter-connections between, immobility/mobility/flows/networks

ways in which I believe go-alongs can enhance our understandings of embodied mobile prac-
tice

the need for a broad palette of methods in the study of mobility

how emotions, sensations, atmospheres and feelings arise
out of relational encounters between objects, spaces and people. 

A key element of cultural geographic research into affect is to ask what is it that
determines the affect that encounters and stimuli have on a person, and why similar stimuli have
different affects in different times and places?

whether
alone or in combination with other methods, go-alongs can vibrantly apprehend mobile
worlds

The question Merriman invites us to ask is what do we as researchers
gain by being or seeing there?

what if the questions we are asking require us to know what
people are feeling on a second-by-second basis in response to environmental stimuli?

aiding recollection and empathy

language – a form of representation not always suited
to describing unconscious bodily phenomena

Husserl, for example, problematised any reflection on phenomeno-
logical experience as both a reduction and potentially a distortion

The point I would make in relation to
these is how MVE as a method is used to create ‘distortions with a purpose’ in that alongside
an interview, it attempts to act as a sensual prompt to recollection, helping to foreground the
aspects of experience we are interested in knowing about and creating a framework through
which to talk about felt experiences arising from relations with fleeting, mundane and easily
forgotten phenomena.

Thus, ‘movement with’ our participants is in part about generating empathic under-
standing

- Aspinall in Edinburgh EEG; phodographer; Christian Nold GSR, talk through the track with the participant, narrative;

Nold: While I would see just a fairly random spiky trail, they saw an
intimate document of their journey, and recounted events which encompassed the full breadth of life:
precarious traffic crossings, encounters with friends, meeting people they fancied, or the nervousness of
walking past the house of an ex-partner.
... People were using the Emotion Map as an embodied memory-trigger for
recounting events that were personally significant for them.

Vergunst has cautioned: ‘turning too readily to high technol-
ogy has the danger that we actually distance ourselves from the experience of movement, in the
very act of trying to get closer to it’.

we will be able to place the senses of touch, smell, kinaesthesia on the same footing
as the visual and audible
