# Mapping the Design Space

This chapter takes a look back at the exemplars and maps them out according to a set of different parameters. Subsequently, I identify gaps in the design space and explain how microinteractions in chance encounters and v√©lomobile formations-in-action fit into the space.

\todo[Make it pretty, structured, visual]

## Parameters

- Context / cyclists' goal (e.g. exercise, commute, experience, flaneurial)
- In motion / not in motion
- Place (road, bicycle path, stop light, crossing, parking, ...)
- Target of interaction (environment, other nearby cyclist/road user, remote person)
- Situation (passing someone/-thing, being passed, riding together, riding alone, ...)
- Explicitness/directness of interaction
- Environmental factors (noise, nature/concrete, motor traffic, time of day...)
- Artefact, if any

## Exemplars & parameters

\todo[way to do...]

@cheng

- Context: exercise
- In motion
- Artefact: bicycling gear/clothing
- Place: road
- Target of interaction: remote cyclist, co-presence, known
- Situation: irrelevant/always
- Indirect, but explicit

@rowland

- Context: interactive experience / art
- Exploration: in motion; Interaction: not in motion
- Artefact: phone
- Place: anywhere/not relevant
- Target of interaction: environment

\todo[Here are actually two experiences that map slightly different!]
