# Workshops & Design Experiments

Describe and reflect on the workshops I held and the design experiments I executed

## Workshop I

What moves the bicycling community in Malm√∂?

"It's just something you do, right?"
"I bike because I take my daughter back and forth, and also for commuting because it's practical"
'When I walk suddenly all the distances seem so far'

#### Results

- Encountering the same people often?

- Usually go around people cause fast, but sometimes you get stuck
- most people are really uncomfortable riding next to a stranger; If I would bike up to someone and ride right next to them, they would see that as really weird
- I ride slower when I don;t have a specific destination
- Swedes are famous for not starting conversations
- Jess: guy rode next to me telling sth in Swedish, dropped my glove

- Cycling for pleasure mostly when it's empty, don't want to ride next to someone
- Sonja: if I know someone, I really like to right next to you
- Weird if someone is directly behind you
- As kids: game where you ride up behind someone and start grinding your front wheel on their back wheel
- Cyclists don;t show with their hands where they;re going. Why to trust them?
- cars don;t use turn signals either
