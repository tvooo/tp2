spinney: the sensory, embodied and social nature of performance
that different methods enable us to ask different questions


techniques such as surveys are too distant from the embodied practice of
cycling, relying at best on verbalised accounts of practice divorced from the context
of doing that is so fundamental to the creation of meaning in mobile practices.

That is not to say that completely ‘new’ methods are required (or even
possible), rather, as Shaw and Hesse (2010, p. 5) aptly comment, what is required is
‘...the tweaking of particular methods capable of harnessing the power of existing
methodologies in mobile situations’.

mobility is always on the move and therefore it is often difficult to apprehend,
record and analyse the multiple and transient contexts and experiences of subjects

In the conduct of urban cycling, however, I
was to encounter diverse groups and individuals who cycled for many different
reasons and in many different ways. As a result there would be much less kinaesthetic
and symbolic consistency in how participants – and indeed I – would interpret the
same practice. As a result auto-ethnography could not provide reliable and generalis-
able insights, an issue that I return to later in the paper in relation to calibrating the
researcher’s body as a research tool.

Lee and Ingold (2006) for example have focused on the practice of walking
to demonstrate how places are created through routes;

Pink (2007) has used a walk-along technique to
show how people perceive the environment through the senses and constitute place
through everyday mundane practice

ride-along as extension to the walk-along; researcher can be present, place of research is always on the move
spinney: ride and talk

In conducting research on the often solitary and traffic-
laden practices of urban cycling for example, my initial problem became one of how
to be able to follow people on everyday journeys and be able to talk to them about
those journeys, ideally in the context of the journey. Whilst useful in certain contexts,
in metropolitan locations a ride-along is often either unsafe or risks precluding the
very practice it seeks to investigate, and therefore another way of accessing the expe-
riences of mobile participants was required.

What is required in such contexts is a method of ‘being there’ without actually being
there

What all
these examples illustrate is the way in which ordinary and fleeting aspects of
everyday life can be apprehended where they were previously missed or glossed over
in the production of more static texts

By facilitating the bringing together of
disparate moments and experiences in the journey, video in this instance allowed the
playfulness and flow of Joe’s journey to be apprehended and understood

Practices and moments previously deemed non-representa-
tional because of their inability to be verbalised, articulated and associated may now
be articulated as representational

In this sense, video becomes a
bridge between embodied practice and language, enhancing the ability of language to
express the ephemeral and embodied

the phenomenological ethnographer uses both body and intellect as research
instruments and might understand personal experiences of cultural concepts that
are otherwise untranslatable, through her or his own embodied experiences.
(Pink, 2006, p. 43)

However, the combina-
tion of audio and visual, coupled with a knowing audience gives video a capacity
for synaesthesia (McDougall, 1997), the mixing and merging of sensory experience
(p. 287):
-> ich mixe und merge die sensory experiences of two different people - research und participant

experiences are shared through
verbal and visual means which serve as bridges to establish mutual understandin

As a result, previously marginalised meanings
are more likely to be articulated and emphasised.

## Interaction Analysis

Thus, expert
knowledge and practice are seen not so much as located in the heads of
individuals but as situated in the interactions among members of a particular
community engaged with the material world.

Throughout this article, we have worked from the premise that accounts of
methods cannot be separated from accounts of findings and that the best way to
talk about methods is to show instances of the actual work. Although this may
be less than elegant and may, at times, dilute the methodological discussion with
substantive findings, we take solace in the fact that emerging fields in general
are more likely to disseminate their methods by example and apprenticeship
than by formal description.

- they first do ethnographic fieldwork: in situ interviews, observation etc
- using this, they identify places/sites/interactional hot spots at which videography tends to be promising
- then they do videography
- for me: bicycle is always moving, so i follow and do both at the same time

we are left with some hours of audiotapes
documenting the analytic thinking of the group
- das mache ich auch; allerdings mache ich die group sessions direkt mit den participants der videography

"locally relevant transcription"

12By anthropologists, the participants' view is often called the "emic" perspective in contrast
to the analysts' "etic" view.

- stop the tape!

periments, fall into this category.13
Video recordings replace the bias of the researcher with the bias of the
machine

We always want to observe the starting up and winding down process
because significant interactions tend to happen at these junctures

- events, beginning and ending, segmentation, how do participants "announce" to each other the recognization of segmentation?

what to look for: "foci for analysis"
- rythm, periodicy
- macro level
- turn-taking
- participation structure: do co-present ppl share a common focus/interest?
- trouble and repair!
- spatial organization of activity
- artefacts


trouble/repair
Analysis of hitches in
interaction may also reveal some of the constraints in the material world that
routinely cause trouble.
bodily, artifactual, spatial, and social resources to
mend infractions of projected sequences.

spatial org of space
socially recognized (although often unstated)
expectations regarding occupancy of space, interaction with others, use of
objects and resources, display of physical presence, and voice

-> ownership of territory, e.g. at a crossing or especially at the roundabout
