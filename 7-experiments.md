## Experiment 1 --- Co-presence

This set of experiments explores the design space between intentional and serendipituous encounters of other bicyclists, both known and strange. Each experiment looks into a different nuance of this design space, but they all have in common that they offer a way to connect two bicyclists who are not physically riding together.

In each experiment, some *artefact* is deployed to extend the bicycle in some way. The relevant part of the device --- which serves as the interface between the bike and the cyclist --- is a range indicator. This could be implemented by an LED strip, a colour screen, or a vibration motor, for instance.

Building on the learnings of the workshop, the workshops are designed to not force feelings of discomfort. Instead, they try to evoke curiosity in a playful way, leading to social interaction "without risk", even for people who would otherwise be too discomforted with them. This becomes most obvious in experiment 1b, where the focus is on strangers' sense of co-presence and their playful negotiation of personal and actual distance.

### Experiment 1a

Focus: finding each other
What does the prototype prototype? Functionality @prototypes

\todo[INSERT PROTOTYPE CHART HERE]

Two people both get a "device" for their bike, which indicates only their proximity to each other.

The indicator does not show any *exact* data. It does not show the distance between the two cyclists, nor does it show the direction of the other cyclist. Some information can be derived by observing the indicator over time.
- the direction: am i going away or not
- is the other cyclist interested in meeting me?
- how quickly is the distance growing/shrinking
- should i turn, or be faster, or be slower?
- is the other one behind of me or in front of me?

The co-presence of the other cyclist is mediated in a very indirect way. 

> "Swarm" for people in motion

The mobile app "Foursquare Swarm" is made for a group to meet at a common place. The purpose of 
You broadcast your current or future location, for example "I'm at Starbucks Malmö Centralen" and subsequently invite others - your friends or even strangers - to join you at this place. Swarm works when you are stationary: if you leave the place before others can get there, there is no way for them to find you. The goal of "meeting up" is therefore missed.

On the move, one can imagine similar situations. Back when I was living in a different part of Malmö, I used to meet up with a friend at a street corner, so we could bicycle to university together. He was living in a district named Rosengård, about 3km from Möllevangen where I was living. Due to the distance and changing weather and traffic situations, it was sometimes difficult to predict when he would be at the meeting point near my home. On the bike, it is difficult to communicate by mobile phone - if you are focused on bicycling, it is quite possible that you do not notice a ringtone or vibrations, and making a call or texting from the bike is not comfortable, either (even ignoring issues of road safety).

As a result, one of us was oftentimes waiting for the other for a few minutes. Apps like Swarm do not help with this problem, as they do not account for being on the move and taking a smartphone out of the pocket while bicycling is not ideal. With this experiment I suggest a playful approach to this problem.

#### Scenario

Two people who know each other (friends) take their bike to the same destination (university). They try to find each other on the way, so that they can ride part of their journeys together.

#### Setup and Briefing

The *device* is implemented as an Android application. The application is installed on both participants' smartphones. They are both briefed together, one or two days before the actual ride. Both participants get a bike mount for their smartphone. They are shown how to start the application and explained how the indicator is to be interpreted. It is made sure that they know that both GPS and 3G have to be enabled in order for the device to work properly. 

Don't ever communicate with each other with other means!!!

#### Execution

The participants' goal is to ride to a common destination (the university) from their respective homes. Ideally they should use the *device* to find each other on the way and ride the rest of the journey together. 

#### Debriefing

The two participants will be debriefed together.

\todo[the debriefing will be recorded via camera]

###### Technical questions

- Did you have difficulties starting up the application and beginning the ride?
- Did you have difficulties using/understanding the indicator?
- Did you have any problems with the GPS? Do you think it worked properly, or did it get lost or jump?
- Did you miss anything from the briefing?

###### Goal-oriented questions

- Did you manage to find each other before arriving at the destination?
- Where did you find each other?

###### Co-presence questions

- Was it easy for you finding each other?
- Did you know if the other participant was in front/behind you?
- Did you know if you were riding into the right direction to both meet each other AND go to uni?
- You know, more or less, where the other one lives. Did you estimate where the other one would be at some point? did you plan your route accordingly?

Idee: einmal mit fester destinaton, einmal mit dem blossen Ziel sich zu finden.

#### Results

\todo[The experiment was not ocnducted yet; therefore, no results]

### Experiment 1b

Focus: Serendipity, chance
What does the prototype prototype? Role, functionality

- can people successfully avoid each other?
Don't tell the participants who else participates, and that they shouldnt tell anyone else! -> strangers

#### Scenario

#### Setup and Briefing

The two participants are briefed independently. They are supposed to not know each other beforehand, and they are supposed to not tell anyone that they are participating in the experiment.

### Experiment 1d

Focus: co-presence (w/o proximity)
What does the prototype prototype? Role

- Wizard of Oz
- One or multiple participants use the artefact for a week
- I am the WoOz - whenever someone uses the app and rides, I check on my dashboard and control their indicator level, hoping to create a sense of co-presence. This could also be done programmatically.

## Experiment 2 --- Mapping the places of sociability

## Experiment 1 --- A route's soundscape

The pilot experiment yielded two time-lapse videos of bicycle rides through Malmö. While listening through the audio files that I recorded in order to retrace the different \phenomenon that I was part of, I noticed a certain quality of the audio: just by listening, I could recall my ride in high detail --- I knew where I was just following along the playback, and the audio recalled detailed memories of the ride.
However, in the end I produced the two time-lapse videos without any sound, as the original audio track sped-up would have sounded ridiculous. The end product, then, missed a richness that the audio could have provided.

This experience led to the planning of Experiment A. Experiment A aims to explore the soundscape of a single route over the time of one day.

- How does the soundscape of a route develop over the time of one day?
- What does the soundscape of one route during different times tell us about the route and the ride?

### Setup

As this experiment aims to compare a single route over time, I picked a route that was convenient for me to ride --- one that I would ride frequently anyway. The route from my home in Rönneholm to the student union building of Malmö University in Dockan server therefore as experiment route. The route starts in a residential area, goes along a park and the city library, as well as along a busy road between a park and the old town, and ends in the industrial area of the harbour.

Prior to each ride, I mounted my phone on my handlebars via a rubber bike mount. I used a simple audio recording app (the same as in the pilot experiment) without a headset/external microphone to capture the soundscape.

\todo[Photo of phone mounted on handlebars]

### Execution

\todo

With the phone mounted, I rode the route as I would normally do --- depending on my mood, my immediate well-being, urgency, and traffic.

Table:  Experiment 1 ride times and durations

As can be seen, the ride durations do not differ much, except for the rides during rush hour. In the following, the different recordings were compared based on their wave form (amplitude) and the actual audio samples.

In order to do so, I created a processing sketch that allowed the presentation of the audio wave forms as well as playback.

- by 'stretching' each track to a certain width, I make sure that the X axis represents the route, rather than the time. Displaying the playhead at the same time position for each track, it has a different visual position as I am somewhere different in the journey.

- draw out noise levels as wave diagram
- allow to play a querschnitt through all the routes
- play the same N seconds of each route, how do they change over time?

> Turning "place" on its head

\todo{definition of place? messeter, maybe? dourish!}

Place is not only defined by geographical dimensions and constraints, but by the meaning that people associate with it.

This experiment suggests the following hypothesis: Riding the bicycle, places are created by riding in different situations and with different co-riders. Thus, whe

During the bicycle ride you enter and leave multiple "places". Looking at the concept of "place" from this perspective opens up new questions: how does a map of these places look? How can I navigate from one place to another?

"Place" is a moving constellation of people; a different constellation means a different place.

@aldred2012 describe  on mobile place-making (a mobile place is constructed in a group ride!)

>  the sociological significance of mobile places, exploring mobile place-making through an analysis of the practice of weekend group leisure cycling. These rides represent a mobility practice where the main aim of participants may be 'leisure' but most infrastructure used is designated for 'transport'..

how to do it: one week of intense journal-keeping?

A visualisation of the social places created during bicycle commuting. A map, so to say.

Recording:
- noise level
- time period
- distance
- "sociable rate" how many ppl around you?
