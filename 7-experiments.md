## Experiment 1 --- Co-presence

This set of experiments explores the design space between intentional and serendipituous encounters of other bicyclists, both known and strange. Each experiment looks into a different nuance of this design space, but they all have in common that they offer a way to connect two bicyclists who are not physically riding together.

In each experiment, some *artefact* is deployed to extend the bicycle in some way. The relevant part of the device --- which serves as the interface between the bike and the cyclist --- is a range indicator. This could be implemented by an LED strip, a colour screen, or a vibration motor, for instance.

Building on the learnings of the workshop, the workshops are designed to not force feelings of discomfort. Instead, they try to evoke curiosity in a playful way, leading to social interaction "without risk", even for people who would otherwise be too discomforted with them. This becomes most obvious in experiment 1b, where the focus is on strangers' sense of co-presence and their playful negotiation of personal and actual distance.

<!--- indicator: LEDs? vibration?
- indicate distance => see if distance is growing or shrinking
- playful: figure out if someone is in front or behind
- playful: slow down or speed up to increase/decrease distance
- sensible: don't be sociable if you don't want to

### Experiment 1a

Focus: finding each other
What does the prototype prototype? Functionality @prototypes

\todo[INSERT PROTOTYPE CHART HERE]

Two people both get a "device" for their bike, which indicates only their proximity to each other.

The indicator does not show any *exact* data. It does not show the distance between the two cyclists, nor does it show the direction of the other cyclist. Some information can be derived by observing the indicator over time.
- the direction: am i going away or not
- is the other cyclist interested in meeting me?
- how quickly is the distance growing/shrinking
- should i turn, or be faster, or be slower?
- is the other one behind of me or in front of me?

The co-presence of the other cyclist is mediated in a very indirect way. 

> "Swarm" for people in motion

The mobile app "Foursquare Swarm" is made for a group to meet at a common place. The purpose of 
You broadcast your current or future location, for example "I'm at Starbucks Malmö Centralen" and subsequently invite others - your friends or even strangers - to join you at this place. Swarm works when you are stationary: if you leave the place before others can get there, there is no way for them to find you. The goal of "meeting up" is therefore missed.

On the move, one can imagine similar situations. Back when I was living in a different part of Malmö, I used to meet up with a friend at a street corner, so we could bicycle to university together. He was living in a district named Rosengård, about 3km from Möllevangen where I was living. Due to the distance and changing weather and traffic situations, it was sometimes difficult to predict when he would be at the meeting point near my home. On the bike, it is difficult to communicate by mobile phone - if you are focused on bicycling, it is quite possible that you do not notice a ringtone or vibrations, and making a call or texting from the bike is not comfortable, either (even ignoring issues of road safety).

As a result, one of us was oftentimes waiting for the other for a few minutes. Apps like Swarm do not help with this problem, as they do not account for being on the move and taking a smartphone out of the pocket while bicycling is not ideal. With this experiment I suggest a playful approach to this problem.

#### Scenario

Two people who know each other (friends) take their bike to the same destination (university). They try to find each other on the way, so that they can ride part of their journeys together.

#### Setup and Briefing

The *device* is implemented as an Android application. The application is installed on both participants' smartphones. They are both briefed together, one or two days before the actual ride. Both participants get a bike mount for their smartphone. They are shown how to start the application and explained how the indicator is to be interpreted. It is made sure that they know that both GPS and 3G have to be enabled in order for the device to work properly. 

Don't ever communicate with each other with other means!!!

#### Execution

The participants' goal is to ride to a common destination (the university) from their respective homes. Ideally they should use the *device* to find each other on the way and ride the rest of the journey together. 

#### Debriefing

The two participants will be debriefed together.

###### Technical questions

- Did you have difficulties starting up the application and beginning the ride?
- Did you have difficulties using/understanding the indicator?
- Did you have any problems with the GPS? Do you think it worked properly, or did it get lost or jump?

###### Goal-oriented questions

- Did you manage to find each other before arriving at the destination?
- Where did you find each other?

###### Co-presence questions

- Was it easy for you finding each other?
- Did you know if the other participant was in front/behind you?
- Did you know if you were riding into the right direction to both meet each other AND go to uni?
- You know, more or less, where the other one lives. Did you estimate where the other one would be at some point? did you plan your route accordingly?

Idee: einmal mit fester destinaton, einmal mit dem blossen Ziel sich zu finden.

#### Results

### Experiment 1b

Focus: Serendipity, chance
What does the prototype prototype? Role, functionality

- can people successfully avoid each other?
Don't tell the participants who else participates, and that they shouldnt tell anyone else! -> strangers

#### Scenario

#### Setup and Briefing

The two participants are briefed independently. They are supposed to not know each other beforehand, and they are supposed to not tell anyone that they are participating in the experiment.

#### Debriefing

## Experiment 2 --- Mapping the places of sociability

> Turning "place" on its head

\todo{definition of place? messeter, maybe? dourish!}

Place is not only defined by geographical dimensions and constraints, but by the meaning that people associate with it.

This experiment suggests the following hypothesis: Riding the bicycle, places are created by riding in different situations and with different co-riders. Thus, whe

During the bicycle ride you enter and leave multiple "places". Looking at the concept of "place" from this perspective opens up new questions: how does a map of these places look? How can I navigate from one place to another?

"Place" is a moving constellation of people; a different constellation means a different place.

@aldred2012 describe  on mobile place-making (a mobile place is constructed in a group ride!)

>  the sociological significance of mobile places, exploring mobile place-making through an analysis of the practice of weekend group leisure cycling. These rides represent a mobility practice where the main aim of participants may be 'leisure' but most infrastructure used is designated for 'transport'..

how to do it: one week of intense journal-keeping?

A visualisation of the social places created during bicycle commuting. A map, so to say.

Recording:
- noise level
- time period
- distance
- "sociable rate" how many ppl around you?
