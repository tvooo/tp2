# Experiments

## Facets/dimensions to look into

- Sociability
- People
- Place
- Proximity --- distance
- Mobility: being in motion
- Mesh
- Communication
- Things: the bike, etc
- The road, roadscape

## Idea / Experiment 1

> "Swarm" for people in motion

The mobile app "Foursquare Swarm"
You broadcast your current or future location, for example "I'm at Starbucks Malmö Centralen" and subsequently invite others - your friends or even strangers - to join you at this place. Swarm works when you are stationary: if you leave the place before others can get there, there is no way for them to find you. The whole purpose of "meeting up" is therefore gone \todo.

On the move, one can imagine similar situations. Back when I was living in a different part of Malmö, I used to meet up with a friend at a street corner, so we could bicycle to university together. He was living in a district named Rosengård, about 3km from Möllevangen where I was living. Due to the distance and changing weather and traffic situations, it was sometimes difficult to predict when he would be at the meeting point near my home. On the bike, it is difficult to communicate by mobile phone - if you are focused on bicycling, it is quite possible that you do not notice a ringtone or vibrations, and making a call or texting from the bike is not comfortable, either (even ignoring issues of road safety).

As a result, one of us was oftentimes waiting for the other for a few minutes. Apps like Swarm do not help with this problem, as they do not account for being on the move and using a smartphone while bicycling is not ideal. With this experiment I suggest a playful approach to this problem.

It offers a way to connect two bicyclists who are not physically riding together.

- indicator: LEDs? vibration?
- indicate distance => see if distance is growing or shrinking
- playful: figure out if someone is in front or behind
- playful: slow down or speed up to increase/decrease distance
- sensible: don't be sociable if you don't want to

- Questions: can people easily find each other using the thing?
- can people successfully avoid each other?

## Idea / Experiment 2

> Turning "place" on its head

\todo{definition of place? messeter, maybe?}

Place is not only defined by geographical dimensions and constraints, but by the meaning that people associate with it.

This experiment suggests the following hypothesis: Riding the bicycle, places are created by riding in different situations and with different co-riders. Thus, whe

During the bicycle ride you enter and leave multiple "places". Looking at the concept of "place" from this perspective opens up new questions: how does a map of these places look? How can I navigate from one place to another?

"Place" is a moving constellation of people; a different constellation means a different place.

>  the sociological significance of mobile places, exploring mobile place-making through an analysis of the practice of weekend group leisure cycling. These rides represent a mobility practice where the main aim of participants may be 'leisure' but most infrastructure used is designated for 'transport'..
