# Experiments

## Facets/dimensions to look into

- Sociability
- People
- Place
- Proximity --- distance
- Mobility: being in motion
- Mesh
- Communication
- Things: the bike, etc
- The road, roadscape

## Idea / Experiment 1

> "Swarm" for people in motion

The mobile app "Foursquare Swarm"
You broadcast your current or future location, for example "I'm at Starbucks Malmö Centralen" and subsequently invite others - your friends or even strangers - to join you at this place. Swarm works when you are stationary: if you leave the place before others can get there, there is no way for them to find you. The whole purpose of "meeting up" is therefore gone \todo.

On the move, one can imagine similar situations. Back when I was living in a different part of Malmö, I used to meet up with a friend.

## Idea / Experiment 2

> Turning "place" on its head
