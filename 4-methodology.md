# Methodology

\todo[This section introduces the methodology used within this thesis project.]

There are three themes that constitute the methodology and inform the activities carried out within this research project: embodiment, representation, and experiments.

Representation -> a way to extract knowledge from experiences
Embodiment -> purely descriptive methodologies must fail to properly represent the experience
Experiments -> allows knowledge to be generated and questions to be asked, yes?


Research question: How can we represent the biking experience and make subtle cycle-based interactions more obvious to design researchers looking to design for cyclists? 

The ways of enquiry in the experiments mostly aim to represent some factors of the bicycling experience, through some sort of mapping and through videography. They are accompanied by phases of reflection-in-action or post-action reflection.



## Embodiment --- experiencing and studying bicycling practice in the field

\todo

Bicycling is a practice that is shaped by embodiment, the placement of the cyclist's body and his acting within the environment. Therefore, to successfully enquire into bicycling practice, one cannot study bicyclists from the lab. Instead, one has to go 'out there' and study bicyclists in situ.

A number of ethnographic studies have been undertaken focusing on cyclists, the most prominent ones in the UK [e.g. @jungnickel, @spinney]. As any societal practice, bicycling depends on culture, and so one can argue that, in order to design for bicyclists in a certain geographical area, one has to conduct ethnographic studies there as well. But bicycling is also a very unique activity; every bicycle ride is different, and depending on what you are designing it might even make more sense to study particular bicyclists over a period of time, instead of looking for general cultural bicycling behaviour through a wide and open ethnographic study.

What did Jungnickel/Aldred do? In-depth interviews, time lapse, informal chats on the bicycle.
What did Spinney do? 



- the knowledge is in the practice of bicycling --- not in the head of the cyclist.

- domain-oriented: spend much time with bicycling
- how are the experiments, specifically #3, domain-specific? would that work in a different context as well? is there a way to make it MORE domain-specific?
- Why no ethnographic studies?
- out in se field very much

- tacit knowledge! difficult for users to communicate (at design time) to
those who design the artifact
Meta-design allows users to extend
the results of self-conscious design activities at design time with
unself-conscious design at use time. These observations drawn
from the domain of architecture have parallels to the design of
interactive systemsâ€”because buildings will be modified many
times, they should be designed with unanticipated future changes
in mind [4].

theoretical paradigm of supporting reflection-in-action

> It's not reflection-in-action, because it is not professional practice that the cyclist reflects upon. However, I can lead the cyclist to consciiusly reflect on his actions and interactions during the ride, make those interactions visible/obvious.
> Reflection-in-action means to reflect on ones immediately previous actions, and adapt the future actions accordingly. But we are only aiming to make action more obvious; the reflection is not meant to create "better" practices of bicycling.

The relation between our own social location and
our view of others is in part what sustains boundaries
among organizational actors, including boundaries
between professional designers of technology and
technology users. - @suchman


## Representation and reflection

> Things are made visible so that they can be seen, talked about, and potentially, manipulated. --- @suchman

- videography method based on @interactionanalysis

spatial and temporal representation

Useing video not only for observation; but for enquiry into bicycling practice

The representations
ethnographers create, accordingly, are as much a
reflection of their own cultural positioning as they
are descriptions of the positioning of others. This is
not a problem or limitation to be overcome; it is a
fundamental aspect of representational work, to be
understood and incorporated into our practices and
into what we produce.

## Design experiments

\todo

The main vehicle of enquiry into cycle-based interaction used in this research project are *design experiments*. @mette argue for the use of, and describe models of, design experiments within programmatic design research. While the research in this thesis is certainly not programmatic, design experiments \todo[are the way to go here].

@lee

Experiments ask questions. What questions do my experiments ask?


My goal is not to create a new method of enquiry; how do you validate a method? Do you compare its results to other methods? How do you decide which results are more valid, or "trueer"?

*Reflection* is the way to validate design experiments.


How can we direct these methods to yield results interesting to the problem at hand?
