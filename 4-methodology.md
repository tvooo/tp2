# Methodology

This chapter introduces the methodological approach that was followed in the activities of this thesis project. It consists of three themes --- embodiment, representation, and experiments --- which are described individually.



There are three themes that constitute the methodology and inform the activities carried out within this research project: embodiment, representation, and experiments.

Representation -> a way to extract knowledge from experiences
Embodiment -> purely descriptive methodologies must fail to properly represent the experience
Experiments -> allows knowledge to be generated and questions to be asked, yes?


Research question: How can we represent the biking experience and make subtle cycle-based interactions more obvious to design researchers looking to design for cyclists? 

The ways of enquiry in the experiments mostly aim to represent some factors of the bicycling experience, through some sort of mapping and through videography. They are accompanied by phases of reflection-in-action or post-action reflection.


## Embodiment --- experiencing and studying bicycling practice in the field

Bicycling is a practice that is shaped by "the sensory, embodied and social nature of performance" [@spinney2011]; embodiment concerns the placement of the cyclist's body and her acting within the environment. It is therefore crucial to perform bicycling research *in the field*, with one's own body and always paying attention to the subject's body.

In order to design for cycle-based interaction, one cannot (only) study bicyclists in the lab. In this, enquirers into the cycling practice seem to agree with each other: the knowledge is in the practice of bicycling, not in the head of the cyclist.



A number of ethnographic studies have been undertaken focusing on cyclists, the most prominent ones in the UK [e.g. @jungnickel, @spinney].

<!--As any societal practice, bicycling depends on culture, and so one can argue that, in order to design for bicyclists in a certain geographical area, one has to conduct ethnographic studies there as well. But bicycling is also a very unique activity; every bicycle ride is different, and depending on what you are designing it might even make more sense to study particular bicyclists over a period of time, instead of looking for general cultural bicycling behaviour through a wide and open ethnographic study.

What did Jungnickel/Aldred do? In-depth interviews, time lapse, informal chats on the bicycle.
What did Spinney do? 

- domain-oriented: spend much time with bicycling
- how are the experiments, specifically #3, domain-specific? would that work in a different context as well? is there a way to make it MORE domain-specific?

### Reflection in situ

- asked them to think aloud. similarily to usability studies in the lab or workplace

Meta-design allows users to extend
the results of self-conscious design activities at design time with
unself-conscious design at use time. These observations drawn
from the domain of architecture have parallels to the design of
interactive systems—because buildings will be modified many
times, they should be designed with unanticipated future changes
in mind [4].

theoretical paradigm of supporting reflection-in-action

> It's not reflection-in-action, because it is not professional practice that the cyclist reflects upon. However, I can lead the cyclist to consciiusly reflect on his actions and interactions during the ride, make those interactions visible/obvious.
> Reflection-in-action means to reflect on ones immediately previous actions, and adapt the future actions accordingly. But we are only aiming to make action more obvious; the reflection is not meant to create "better" practices of bicycling.

The relation between our own social location and
our view of others is in part what sustains boundaries
among organizational actors, including boundaries
between professional designers of technology and
technology users. - @suchman


## Representation

> *Things are made visible so that they can be seen, talked about, and potentially, manipulated.* --- @suchman

As stated earlier, much knowledge about the practice of bicycling is not in the cyclist's consciousness, but in her body. It is *tacit*, which means it is difficult for the cyclist to communicate it to the designer-researcher in situ. However, re-presentation of an experience can help codify this knowledge, as @spinney2011 suggests.

When researching cycle-based interaction, the designer-researcher needs to make the subtle interactions obvious in order to be able to consider them in the design process. For this, @ia describe a research practice called Interaction Analysis. It makes use of audiovisual recording, transcription, and re-views with analysts and subjects. @spinney2011 further elaborates how video ethnography can be used in bicycling research.
Two of the experiments described in chapter \todo make use of videographic methods, and I subsequently reflect on them in relation to Interaction Analysis and Spinney's framework.

Video, however, is not the only medium of representation I apply in my experiments; the other one is mapping. While I use videography in a way that is focusing on a single bicyclist's interactions, I use mapping in a way that encompasses many cyclists and aims to *extrapolate* possible spaces for interaction.

\todo[write on mapping for representation]

### Reflection through representation

@ia correctly recognise the bias of camera operator, technology, and analyst in doing Interaction Analysis using videography; they remind the researcher to always be aware of those biases. However, I think they are missing a point that @suchman states as follows:

> *The representations ethnographers create, accordingly, are as much a reflection of their own cultural positioning as they are descriptions of the positioning of others. This is not a problem or limitation to be overcome; it is a fundamental aspect of representational work, to be understood and incorporated into our practices and into what we produce.*

In other words: we should embrace and make use of the interpretive power of representations, while never just seeing representations as empirically definite. In my research work, videography is not simply used to observe and describe, but to enquire into and have a conversation with bicycling practice. This takes place by deliberate manipulation of the video material to represent otherwise invisible events, and by conversing over the video material in a similar way that @ia suggest.

Maps are affected by biases in the same way; this becomes very explicit in my own reflections on experiment #3. They discuss how the outcome --- a map highlighting places with good conditions for cycle-based interaction in Malmö --- depends not only on the data, but also on the designer-researcher's choice of parameter: how many rides in one area make an area "frequently visited"? how slow is slow?

## Design experiments

\todo

This thesis does not aim towards creating a new, better method for enquiry into cycle-based interaction.

The main vehicle of enquiry into cycle-based interaction used in this research project are *design experiments*. @mette argue for the use of, and describe models of, design experiments within programmatic design research. While the research in this thesis is certainly not programmatic, design experiments \todo[are the way to go here].

@lee

Experiments ask questions. What questions do my experiments ask?


My goal is not to create a new method of enquiry; how do you validate a method? Do you compare its results to other methods? How do you decide which results are more valid, or "trueer"?

*Reflection* is the way to validate design experiments.


How can we direct these methods to yield results interesting to the problem at hand?
