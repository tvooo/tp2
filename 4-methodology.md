# Methodology

This chapter introduces the methodological framework that defines the activities of this thesis project. It encompasses the concepts of 'being there', the creation and use of representations, and the exploration of the design space through experiments.


<!--

There are three themes that constitute the methodology and inform the activities carried out within this research project: embodiment, representation, and experiments.

Representation -> a way to extract knowledge from experiences
Embodiment -> purely descriptive methodologies must fail to properly represent the experience
Experiments -> allows knowledge to be generated and questions to be asked, yes?


Research question: How can we represent the biking experience and make subtle cycle-based interactions more obvious to design researchers looking to design for cyclists? 

The ways of enquiry in the experiments mostly aim to represent some factors of the bicycling experience, through some sort of mapping and through videography. They are accompanied by phases of reflection-in-action or post-action reflection.

## 'Being there' --- experiencing and studying bicycling practice in the field

Bicycling is a practice that is shaped by "the sensory, embodied and social nature of performance" [@spinney2011]; embodiment concerns the placement of the cyclist's body and her acting within the environment. It is therefore crucial to perform bicycling research *in the field*, with one's own body and always paying attention to the subject's body and interactions.

In order to design for cycle-based interaction, one cannot (only) study bicyclists in the lab. In this, enquirers into the cycling practice seem to agree with each other: the knowledge is in the practice of bicycling, not in the head of the cyclist.

Spinney states that "techniques such as surveys are too distant from the embodied practice of cycling, relying at best on verbalised accounts of practice divorced from the context of doing that is so fundamental to the creation of meaning in mobile practices." [-@spinney2011] And as many studies successfully show, ethnography provides more capable tools to capture the experience of bicycling: they do not only rely on in-depth interviews or informal chats, but on ride-alongs and videography. Spinney also expressed the importance of domain-orientation: in order to study bicycling, it sure helps to spend time on the bicycle and with bicyclists.

#### Reflection in situ

'Being there' affords a mode of reflection that does not happen after, but *during* the bicycle ride. @beyer describe Contextual Inquiry, part of which is a *think aloud* --- the activity of verbally describing what you are doing and why you are doing it at the exact moment of doing it. For Beyer and Holtzblatt, it is also important for the researcher and subject to take on roles similar to 'apprentice' and 'master' --- the researcher tries to learn from the subject.
The way of reflecting that is required in a Contextual Inquiry is what @schoen calls 'reflection-on-action'.

To complement existing videographic methods, this mode of reflecting in situ can lead the cyclist to make her subtle actions and interactions more obvious to the researcher. Therefore, to explore the ways that reflection in situ might contribute to research methodology, I let the work of Schön and Beyer & Holtzblatt inform one of my experiments.

## Representation

> *Things are made visible so that they can be seen, talked about, and potentially, manipulated.* --- @suchman

As stated earlier, much knowledge about the practice of bicycling is not in the cyclist's consciousness, but in her body. It is *tacit*, which means it is difficult for the cyclist to communicate it to the designer-researcher in situ. However, re-presentation of an experience can help codify this knowledge, as @spinney2011 suggests.

When researching cycle-based interaction, the researcher needs to make the subtle interactions obvious in order to be able to consider them in the design process. For this, @ia describe a research practice called Interaction Analysis. It makes use of audiovisual recording, transcription, and re-views with analysts and subjects. @spinney2011 further elaborates how video ethnography can be used in bicycling research.
Two of the experiments described in chapter \todo make use of videographic methods, and I subsequently reflect on them in relation to Interaction Analysis and Spinney's framework.

Video, however, is not the only medium of representation I apply in my experiments; the other one is mapping. While I use videography in a way that is focusing on a single bicyclist's interactions, I use mapping in a way that encompasses many cyclists and aims to *extrapolate* possible spaces for interaction.

#### Reflection through representation

@ia correctly recognise the bias of camera operator, technology, and analyst in doing Interaction Analysis using videography; they remind the researcher to always be aware of those biases. However, I think they are missing a point that @suchman states as follows:

> *The representations ethnographers create, accordingly, are as much a reflection of their own cultural positioning as they are descriptions of the positioning of others. This is not a problem or limitation to be overcome; it is a fundamental aspect of representational work, to be understood and incorporated into our practices and into what we produce.*

In other words: we should embrace and make use of the interpretive power of representations, while never just seeing representations as empirically definite. In my research work, videography is not simply used to observe and describe, but to enquire into and have a conversation with bicycling practice. This takes place by deliberate manipulation of the video material to represent otherwise invisible events, and by conversing over the video material in a similar way that @ia suggest.

Maps are affected by biases in the same way; this becomes very explicit in my own reflections on experiment #3. They discuss how the outcome --- a map highlighting places with good conditions for cycle-based interaction in Malmö --- depends not only on the data, but also on the designer-researcher's choice of parameter: how many rides in one area make an area "frequently visited"? How slow is slow?

## Design experiments

This thesis does not aim towards creating a new, better method for enquiry into cycle-based interaction. Instead, I aim to explore the design space of tools for the enquiry into cycle-based interaction. The main vehicle for this exploration is a set of *design experiments*.

@mette argue for the use of, and describe models of, design experiments within programmatic design research. While the research in this thesis is certainly not programmatic, the explorative nature affords a similar approach. While it is not reflected in the final report, I reframed the research questions multiple times during the course of this project: from an initial focus on possible design openings for vélomobile formations-in-action, towards ways to enquire into it, finally to an exploration of methodological instruments for cycle-based interaction research.
