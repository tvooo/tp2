Dear all :)

I am a student of interaction design at Malmö Högskola, and for my Master's thesis I am researching a phenomenon related to urban bicycling. For this, I would like to have a workshop with people who regularly ride the bike in Malmö.
My research focuses on short, random encounters of bicyclists who temporarily ride together during part of their respective journeys. I am looking for social and technological design opportunities that make use of these encounters. The goal of this workshop would be to find out matters of concern of bicyclists (e.g. safety, sociality, efficiency...) and to explore the experience that they have with those random encounters.

The workshop will take place on Thursday, April 9th, in Västra Hamnen from 11:00 until ca 12:00. I know this is not a good time for everyone who is working or has lectures, but I hope I can still find a few attendees. No matter if you bike professionally, as a hobby, for leisure or just because you have to - I would be happy to have you in my workshop :) I cannot offer anything for your participation, but of course there will be some fika!

If you have time and interest, I'll be glad to hear from you :) PM me and we can settle the details. Thanks so much!

Happy easter to everybody!
