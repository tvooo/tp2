# Abstract {-}

Bicycling is an embodied and social practice. When designing for cycle-based experience, interaction designers face many problems: mobility, ephemerality, bad representations, etc.
This thesis builds on the work of existing ethnographic methods in cycling research to explore new ways of enquiry that helps designers find about what really happens on the bicycle. BAM!

In public spaces, we constantly interact with each other --- whether we are aware of it or not. Most of these interactions are indirect and subtle, ranging from flaneurial people-watching to passive agression. This is not only true for pedestrians in public spaces, but equally so for bicyclists.

While there exists a history of ethnographic studies into into bicyclists' behaviour, it proves to be difficult to enquire into these more subtle interactions, as they are short, nearly invisible, and appear sporadic and not planned. 
-> they are hard to observe
On the other hand, these interactions seem important. They make life in the public sphere what it is, and it would be totally idiotic to neglect them when designing for cycle-based interaction. There are opportunities both to enhance the quality of these interaction, as well as to use them to trigger something else. I guess.

Focusing on face-to-face interaction (rather than on digitally mediated interaction) and v√©lomobile formations-in-action specifically, this thesis project explores ways to enquire into cycle-based interactions in order to support interaction design research and practice.
