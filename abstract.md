# Abstract {-}

In public spaces, we constantly interact with each other --- whether we are aware of it or not. Most of these interactions are indirect and subtle, ranging from flâneurial people-watching, over re-negotiation of turns in traffic, to passive aggression. This is not only true for pedestrians, but equally so for bicyclists.

Bicycling is an embodied and social practice. When designing for cycle-based experiences, interaction designers face many problems while conducting research: mobility is always on the move and therefore hard to capture; the fleeting moments of interaction are almost invisible to the eye; and verbal accounts of bicyclists fail to represent the experiential qualities of a ride properly.
While there exists a history of ethnographic studies into into bicyclists' behaviour, it proves to be difficult to enquire into these more subtle interactions.
On the other hand, these interactions seem important. They make life in the public sphere what it is, and it would be naive to neglect them when designing for cycle-based interaction.

This thesis builds on the work of existing ethnographic methods in cycling research to explore new ways of enquiry that helps designers find out *what really happens* on the bicycle.
