# Activity 1

## Infrastructure

### Good

- Underpasses
- wide and many bike paths/lanes
- air pumps
- bike traffic lights
- bike parking at Centralen
- hand rails at traffic lights
- wastebins for throwing while riding

### Bad

- lots of glass on bike paths
- bike stands don't allow for locking the frame
- bike stands are too narrow for tires/wheels
- transporting the bike on train/bus is a pain in the ass
- speed bumps
- why can't i bike across the bridge?
- areas without bike lanes or where I don't know where the bike lanes are
- narrow bike paths; bad if someone is going really slow, or with cargo bikes, or if you chat with someone
- zebra crossings without stop lights are dangerous

## Environment

### Good

- Flat
- Short distances to everywhere

### Bad

- Tree roots coming out of the surface
- Wind is a problem
- bad weather: wind, rain

## Bike itself

### Good

- Cargo bikes
- cargo bikes that transport kidnergarten kids

### Bad

## Community / social / other people/vehicles

- slow traffic - both good and bad!

### Good

# Ideas

- Adaptive tandems / ad-hoc tandems
- handrail dating service
- zebra crossing: the more bikes the more likely that cars will stop
- bike patgs vibrate to scare pedestrians off the path when big group is approaching
- wind-powered bikes drachen
- special bike trains/busses for groups of cyclists
