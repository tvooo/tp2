# Introduction



Bicycling is often considered to be a very solitary activity. But even when we are not riding intentionally in a group --- be it for a bicycle tour or as a group commute --- bicycling can still be a social experience, as it does not take place in isolation, but "in complex choreography with other multi-modal road users" [@outthere].

Compared to other modes of transportation, bicycling offers a unique combination of experiential qualities. Bicycling happens 'out there', outside of an enclosed room, which allows us to use all our senses and experience the trip and the environment with our whole body. This allows for complex interaction which would not be possible e.g. within a car. At the same time, bicycling happens at a much higher pace than walking, which limits the range of possible interactions somewhat.

The importance of bicyclists for the socio-urban landscape has been recognized by city planners and social scientists alike. Researchers like Katrina Jungnickel, Rachel Aldred, Paul McIlvenny and Justin Spinney focus on bicycling as a social practice in much of their work. But bicycling communities themselves are starting to put more emphasis on social practice as well.

The *Slow Roll* movement ^[See [http://www.slowroll.bike/](http://www.slowroll.bike/)], in analogy to the *Slow Food* movement, promotes a more conscious bicycling experience. Bicycling communities meet to ride a tour through their city, along neighbourhoods and points of interest. 'Slow Roll' means to ride at a slow pace, allowing for appreciation of the cycling experience and social interaction. *Slow Roll* was started in Detroit, MI, USA in 2010 and has since spread over 9 other cities. It is safe to assume that many more informal meet-ups of this kind are taking place in many parts of the world.

A less well-defined social phenomenon can be observed under the hashtag `#CoffeeOutside` on social media like Twitter and Instagram. On their way cycling to work, people in cities all over the world stop and meet to have a coffee outside, together. While this movement has emerged from coffee enthusiasm, many arrive to the meet-ups by bike, and the notion of togetherness and spending time outside overlap deeply into bicycling culture.

With this new appreciation for social bicycling in mind, I aim to explore a phenomenon that I call *random vélomobile formations-in-action*, which will be described further in the following section. Some research has happened touching this phenomenon, namely @esbjornsson on encounters when motorcycling, @mcilvenny on *intentional* rather than *random* vélomobile formations-in-action, and @cromwell with an urban planning approach to indirect social interaction on bikes. Yet so far no one has explored the interaction design space encompassing this phenomenon.
