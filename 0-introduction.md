# Introduction

<!-- Ok, what's this about? -->

Bicycling is often considered to be a very solitary activity. But even when we are not riding in an intentional group --- be it for a bicycle tour or as a group commute --- bicycling can still be a social experience, as it does not take place in isolation, but "in complex choreography with other multi-modal road users" [@outthere, p. 29].

Compared to other modes of transportation, bicycling offers a unique combination of experiential qualities. Bicycling happens 'out there', outside of an enclosed room, which allows us to use all our senses and experience the trip and the environment with our whole body. This facilitates complex interaction which would not be possible e.g. within a car. At the same time, bicycling happens at a much higher pace than walking, which limits the range of possible interactions to some extent.

The importance of bicyclists for the socio-urban landscape has been recognized by city planners, social scientists, and designers alike. Researchers like Katrina Jungnickel, Rachel Aldred, Paul McIlvenny and Justin Spinney focus on bicycling as a social practice in much of their work. But bicycling communities themselves are starting to put more emphasis on social practice as well:

The *Slow Roll* movement^[See [http://www.slowroll.bike/](http://www.slowroll.bike/)], in analogy to the *Slow Food* movement, promotes a more conscious bicycling experience. Bicycling communities meet to ride a slow tour through their city, along neighbourhoods and points of interest, allowing for appreciation of the cycling experience and social interaction.
A different bicycle-related social phenomenon can be observed under the hashtag `#CoffeeOutside` on social media like Twitter and Instagram. On their way cycling to work, people in cities all over the world stop and meet to have a coffee outside, together.
The *Critical Mass* movement^[See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_%28cycling%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_%28cycling%29)] is a series of mass bicycle rides all over the world. Goals differ between the various rides, but some want to be seen as protest over the motorization and bad bicycling conditions in cities, others want to be seen as a celebration instead.

<!-- Ok, that's nice. But what does that have to do with design? -->

Yet all these intentional, planned interactions that happen when meeting up for a ride (like the ones above) tell only part of the story. When cyclists ride only for themselves, for example to commute or run errands, they encounter many other cyclists. Interaction takes place here as well, but in a much more subtle way. Explicit interaction, such as starting a conversation, is often unwanted and uncomfortable; thus, this research focuses on indirect interactions.

One phenomenon that is largely unexplored are so-called *vélomobile formations-in-action*. @mcilvenny describes them as the different formations a pair of cyclists can take in order to sustain a conversation. However, these formations and the processes of entering and leaving them happen as well with strangers; here, they might serve other purposes than conversations. *Chance encounters* happen all the time, and the subtle interactions are numerous: For example a negotiation of pace when trying to pass another cyclist; for example a mutual, silent appreciation of each other's bicycle; for example a demonstration of physical stamina when overtaking someone else with high speed on an upward slope.
These microinteractions contribute to the total experience of every bicycle journey, and they make up one of the differences to riding the car: the opportunity to engage with other people and the environment in a direct way.

<!-- Now we're talking. What's your role in this? -->

Designers are starting to recognise the possibilities that everyday mundane road interactions offer. The Hocman project, described by @esbjornsson, tries to create a space for interaction after brief encounters between motorcyclists; @cromwell approaches indirect social interaction on bicycles from the standpoint of urban planning and landscape architecture; @cheng design for co-presence during bicycling exercise; and @rowland derive guidelines for designing cycle-based interactive experiences. Looking at the numerous ways that bicyclists engage with other road users and the environment, one can see the role that interaction design can play in shaping the future socio-urban space. This will become even more relevant while cities adapt to the growing number of cyclists.

In order to design for bicyclists, we must find ways to capture and represent their subtle interactions on the road. Using a framework of design experiments, ethnographic methodology, reflection and representation, I explore the space around my research question: *How can we create representations that convey a richer account of the bicycling experience and use them to enquire more deeply into cycle-based interactions?*
The result is a repertoire of methodological contributions --- research tools ---, based on videography, audiography, and mapping. They may be of interest to any enquirer into bicycling practice: design practitioners, design researchers and ethnographers alike.
