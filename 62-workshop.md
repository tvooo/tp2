## Workshop --- What moves the Malmö bicycling community?

In order to get a general understanding of the bicycling culture in Malmö, as well as to learn about bicyclists' understanding of vélomobile formations-in-action during chance encounters, I conducted a workshop at the beginning of the project phase. This section describes the workshop structure, tasks, and outcomes.

### Participants

The workshop had four participants; three students and one full-time employee. Two participants were female, the other two were male. The participants were all of different nationalities. All participants names "commute" as their main reason to cycle; however, one also stated "I bike because I take my daughter back and forth", and two others said they would bike just for fun sometimes.

### Activity I

The first activity stood under the general question "What *moves* cyclists in Malmö?". The goal was to identify topics that are of high importance to Malmö's bicycling community. These topics could be positive, negative, or neutral, and could be as general as "the bad weather" and as specific as "the confusing roundabout near Kungsgatan".

The format of this activity was a short, solo brainstorming session followed by a round of presenting and discussing the results. Finally, we created an affinity diagram of the topics.

The outcomes were quite balanced between positive and negative impressions. The clustering showed that two topics are especially concerning for the participants: *infrastructure* and *other road users*. Other topics of concern were the *bike* itself and the *environment*. These four clusters provide design spaces for different disciplines, such as urban planning, landscape architecture, and interaction design.

### Activity II

After the first activity, I introduced the participants to the concept of vélomobile formations-in-action. I showed one of the time-lapse videos that were produced during the pilot experiment, and told a story reminiscent of the narrative in chapter \ref{theoretical-framework}.
After making sure that everyone had an understanding of the phenomenon at hand, I asked the participants to share their own experiences with it. This took place in a conversational manner.

The participants agreed that they had not thought about these situations consciously before. They also agreed that in most cases, they do not take any effort to stay together with someone else --- three said they would probably overtake other cyclists, except if they got stuck because of oncoming traffic. One participant stated that she never talked to a stranger while on the bike.
If they would bike up to a stranger and stay next to them for a while, the participants stated that it would make themselves really uncomfortable. They expected the stranger to perceive it as privacy-invading and odd. Partly, they grounded this assumption in Swedish culture: "Swedes are famous for not starting conversations." While only one of the four participants was Swedish, this activity shows that the cultural background and the goal of the cyclists cannot be disregarded. Looking at the participants' goals when riding, most of them stated that they ride for utility purposes mostly ("It's just something you do, right?"). Two of them, however, mentioned that they would sometimes ride just for fun --- without a specific destination, but more in a flâneurial manner. In these cases they would bike slower, not trying to overtake everyone they encounter.

It was also mentioned that vélomobile formations-in-action during chance encounters were probably more common in Copenhagen than in Malmö. In Copenhagen, some bicycle paths have nearly the character of *roads* or *highways*, and you can often see "road trains" of bikes passing by.

### Activity III

The aim of the last activity was to connect the themes identified during Activity I to random vélomobile formations-in-action, which had been introduced in Activity II. This was executed as a form of brainstorming in groups of two. Each group picked three themes that they found most interesting; I then asked them to come up with as many ideas that would connect their themes to vélomobile formations-in-action, either fostering them or making use of them in some way. The participants had 10 minutes for this activity.

This proved quite difficult for the participants. While some results came up that related to these formations, most drifted away from the original goal.

Handrail dating
  ~ In Malmö, many bicycle path crossings with traffic lights have handrails on their side. Bicyclists can rest their hands and feet on them while waiting for the light to turn green, without having to get off the saddle. One idea that came up was to match romance-seeking bicyclists at these spots, similar to a service like Tinder^[Tinder is a mobile dating application, see [http://www.gotinder.com/](http://www.gotinder.com/)]. The cyclist at the front of the handrail could express interest in the one on the opposite side of the crossing. Another variation we discussed was to do a sort of biological matching depending on the cyclists hand- and fingerprints. While this idea is about chance encounters, it does not concern vélomobile formations-in-action.

Ad-hoc tandem
  ~ A bicycle model that, together with others of its kind, can quickly be assembled into an ad-hoc tandem. Just by owning this kind of bicycle, people express interest in meeting other people. We thought that this could be especially interesting to people who are new to a city and seek someone to explore it with, or for tourists with the same intention.

Mesh messaging
  ~ Using proximity of two cyclists, a message could be spread over from one cyclist to the next. This sort of mesh messaging was used, for example, in Hongkong during the student protests of 2014^[See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_class_boycott_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_class_boycott_campaign)] while the cell network was overloaded. It is easy to imagine variations thereof, most of them as games: a team tag game in which you tag other, unknown bicyclists, by means of their Bluetooth fingerprint; a game where you have to spread a message from one place in the city to another, without actually going there; a way of peer-to-peer file-sharing without a centralized network.

    All these rely on people riding close to each other for at least short time. In case of a game, this time could be artificially extended, by requiring that you have to stay at least `n` seconds next to someone --- which would sometimes even force you to take a different route than you intended.

### Reflection

This workshop intended to get an overall impression on the bicycling community in Malmö. It was quite challenging to find any participants at all, and one can say that the four participants of this workshop are not representative for the bicycling community in Malmö.

The workshop format seems reasonable to uncover general issues of concern for a biking community. The participants did not have a hard time recalling why they like to bicycle in Malmö, and what factors are detrimental to their ride experience. They had, however, more difficulties when the focus changed towards vélomobile formations-in-action. While they all understood the concept, it was hard for them to relate to these phenomena out of context. The workshop format seems not suitable to enquire into specific interactions, especially if they are rather subtle and experiential. This is an interesting learning outcome in itself --- other methods might be more successful.

That being said, the workshop results are still interesting and relevant. A common theme of the ideas generated in Activity III is *playful interaction*. While only the last of the ideas listed in the previous section could be an actual *game*, it can be said that ad-hoc tandems and handrail dating at least have a playful side to it. Another relevant outcome is the collection of relevant themes. The four identified clusters offer different foci for possible future research in interaction design, landscape architecture, sociology, politics, and more.
