## Workshop --- What moves the Malmö bicycling community?

In order to identify the purpose of each experiment, I use the model suggested by @prototypes.

In order to get a general understanding of the bicycling culture in Malmö, as well as to learn about bicyclists' understanding of \phenomenon, I conducted a workshop at the beginning of the project phase. This section describes the workshop structure, tasks, and outcomes.

"It's just something you do, right?"
"I bike because I take my daughter back and forth, and also for commuting because it's practical"
'When I walk suddenly all the distances seem so far'

The workshop was designed with the intention in mind to design for SOCIAL INTERACTION on the bicycle regarding \phenomenon. 

### Preparation

The workshop had four participants; three students and one full-time employee. Two participants were female, the other two were male.

### Activity I

The first activity stood under the general questions "What *moves* cyclists in Malmö?". The goal was to identify topics that are of high importance for Malmö's bicycling community. These topics could be positive, negative or neutral, and could be as general as "the bad weather" and as specific as "the confusing roundabout near Kungsgatan".

The format of this activity was a short, solo brainstorming session followed by a round of presenting and discussing the results, followed by creating an affinity diagram of the topics.

- brainstorm topics of concern or enjoyment
- write them down on post-it notes
- cluster them
- results?

### Activity II

After the first activity, I introduced the participants to the concept of \phenomenon. I showed one of the time-lapse videos that were produced during the pre-experiment, and told a story reminiscent of the narrative in chapter \todo[2].
After making sure that everyone had an understanding of the phenomenon at hand, I asked the participants to share their own experiences with it. This took place in a conversational manner.

The participants agreed that they have not thought about these situations consciously before. They also agreed that in most cases, they do not take any effort to stay together with someone else --- three said they would probably pass by other cyclists, except if they get stuck because of oncoming traffic. One participant stated that she never talked to a stranger while on the bike.
If they would bike up to a stranger and stay next to them for a while, the participants stated that it would make themselves really uncomfortable. They expected the stranger to perceive it as privacy-invading and odd. Partly, they ground this assumption in Swedish culture: "Swedes are famous for not starting conversations." \todo[get correct citation] However, only one of the four participants was Swedish.

#### Results

- Encountering the same people often?
- Road trains on bikes
- Usually go around people cause fast, but sometimes you get stuck
- most people are really uncomfortable riding next to a stranger; If I would bike up to someone and ride right next to them, they would see that as really weird
- I ride slower when I don;t have a specific destination
- Swedes are famous for not starting conversations
- Jess: guy rode next to me telling sth in Swedish, dropped my glove
- Sonja: never talked to anyone; don't like at stop lights, always try to go ahead; stephan driving up from behind and pushing her
- Cycling for pleasure mostly when it's empty, don't want to ride next to someone
- Sonja: if I know someone, I really like to right next to you
- Weird if someone is directly behind you
- As kids: game where you ride up behind someone and start grinding your front wheel on their back wheel
- Cyclists don;t show with their hands where they;re going. Why to trust them?
- cars don;t use turn signals either

### Activity III

The aim of the last activity was to connect the themes identified during Activity I to \phenomenon, which was introduced in Activity II. This was executed as "seeded brainstorming" \todo[quelle?] in groups of two. Each group picked three themes that they found most interesting and were asked to come up with as many ideas regarding \phenomenon and the themes that they could \todo[time?].

* A dating service that matches people who are holding the handrails on opposite sides of a traffic light.
* A bicycle that --- if multiple bikes of this model meet --- can quickly be \todo[composed] into a tandem bicycle.
* dragon? 

- christmas time; ppl on the train to get to know each other; couples who actually met on the train, or who become best friends
- if you bike on regular hours you start seeing the same people. fredrik sees two walkers
- on the traffic light, would rather interact with the person on the other side; this swedish song
- traffic mob? berlin. sonja fragen
- led art on bikes
- bike flash mobs
- bike gangs
- el wire
- mesh messaging, like they used in hongkong
- mit project: donkey that acts as message queue
- bike messenger
- bike taxi service?
