## Workshop --- What moves the Malmö bicycling community?

In order to get a general understanding of the bicycling culture in Malmö, as well as to learn about bicyclists' understanding of \phenomenon, I conducted a workshop at the beginning of the project phase. This section describes the workshop structure, tasks, and outcomes.

<!--"I bike because I take my daughter back and forth, and also for commuting because it's practical"

<!-- The workshop was designed with the intention in mind to design for  on the bicycle regarding \phenomenon. -->

### Participants

The workshop had four participants; three students and one full-time employee. Two participants were female, the other two were male. The participants were all of different nationalities.

### Activity I

> "It's just something you do, right?"

The first activity stood under the general questions "What *moves* cyclists in Malmö?". The goal was to identify topics that are of high importance for Malmö's bicycling community. These topics could be positive, negative or neutral, and could be as general as "the bad weather" and as specific as "the confusing roundabout near Kungsgatan".

The format of this activity was a short, solo brainstorming session followed by a round of presenting and discussing the results, followed by creating an affinity diagram of the topics.

\todo[Insert diagram of clusters?]

In terms of attitude, the outcomes were quite balanced between positive and negative. The clustering showed that two topics are especially concerning for the participants: *infrastructure* and *other road users*. Other topics of concern were the bike itself and the environment.

These clusters are especially interesting, because they name the four possible targets of any interaction: other people (cyclists, pedestrians, etc.), the bicycle, and the surroundings (infrastructure, bicycle facilities, nature, etc.).

### Activity II

After the first activity, I introduced the participants to the concept of \phenomenon. I showed one of the time-lapse videos that were produced during the pre-experiment, and told a story reminiscent of the narrative in chapter \todo[2].
After making sure that everyone had an understanding of the phenomenon at hand, I asked the participants to share their own experiences with it. This took place in a conversational manner.

The participants agreed that they have not thought about these situations consciously before. They also agreed that in most cases, they do not take any effort to stay together with someone else --- three said they would probably pass by other cyclists, except if they get stuck because of oncoming traffic. One participant stated that she never talked to a stranger while on the bike.
If they would bike up to a stranger and stay next to them for a while, the participants stated that it would make themselves really uncomfortable. They expected the stranger to perceive it as privacy-invading and odd. Partly, they ground this assumption in Swedish culture: "Swedes are famous for not starting conversations." \todo[get correct citation] However, only one of the four participants was Swedish.

This activity showed me that the cultural background and the goal of the cyclists cannot be disregarded. \todo[More] 

#### Results

\todo[Integrate this into the previous section as far as makes sense]

\todo[Name activity 2 results]

<!--
- D2 Encountering the same people often?
- D2 Road trains on bikes
- D2 Usually go around people cause fast, but sometimes you get stuck
- G1 most people are really uncomfortable riding next to a stranger; If I would bike up to someone and ride right next to them, they would see that as really weird
- D1 I ride slower when I don;t have a specific destination
- D2 Swedes are famous for not starting conversations
- D1: guy rode next to me telling sth in Swedish, dropped my glove
- G1: never talked to anyone; don't like at stop lights, always try to go ahead; so driving up from behind and pushing her
- G2 Cycling for pleasure mostly when it's empty, don't want to ride next to someone
- G1: if I know someone, I really like to right next to you
- ?? Weird if someone is directly behind you
- D2 As kids: game where you ride up behind someone and start grinding your front wheel on their back wheel
- G1? Cyclists don;t show with their hands where they;re going. Why to trust them?
- AA cars don;t use turn signals either

### Activity III

The aim of the last activity was to connect the themes identified during Activity I to \phenomenon, which was introduced in Activity II. This was executed as "seeded brainstorming" \todo[quelle?] in groups of two. Each group picked three themes that they found most interesting and were asked to come up with as many ideas regarding \phenomenon and the themes that they could \todo[time?]. \todo[More here]

\todo[Name activity 3 results]

* A dating service that matches people who are holding the handrails on opposite sides of a traffic light.
* A bicycle that --- if multiple bikes of this model meet --- can quickly be \todo[composed] into a tandem bicycle.
* dragon?

<!--
- christmas time; ppl on the train to get to know each other; couples who actually met on the train, or who become best friends
- if you bike on regular hours you start seeing the same people. fredrik sees two walkers
- on the traffic light, would rather interact with the person on the other side; this swedish song
- traffic mob? berlin. sonja fragen
- led art on bikes
- bike flash mobs
- bike gangs
- el wire
- mesh messaging, like they used in hongkong
- mit project: donkey that acts as message queue
- bike messenger
- bike taxi service?
- iBeacon
- if you have an accident, 'call' the closest cyclist

### Reflect

\todo

- Did this workshop yield the desired results?
- What did I learn to carry over to design the following experiments?
- What design advice came out of the workshop? -> the four clusters

This workshop format seems reasonable to uncover general issues of concern for a biking community. The participants did not have a hard time recalling why they like to bicycle in Malmö, and what factors are detrimental to their ride experience.

- not suitable to find specific interactions; bad to enquire into special phenomena
- experiential
- subtle
- memory is apparently not focused
- ppl recalled bad situations, but not nice ones
