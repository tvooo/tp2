# Conclusions

While it was not explicitly discussed in this report --- after all, this is only a verbalised snapshot of my process --- the focus of my work shifted significantly over the course of my research. Initially, I wanted to find design openings regarding vélomobile formations-in-action that occur spontaneously. When I noticed that this phenomenon was not properly researched and difficult to both capture and represent, I reframed by research question towards methodology: *How can we create representations that convey a richer account of the bicycling experience and use them to enquire more deeply into cycle-based interactions?*

The subsequent research was explorative; instead of trying to develop one definite method, I experimented with different aspects in the space of possible design research methodology: audiography, mapping, and videography. It is safe to say that there are many more directions still to explore. If we want to fully understand what is happening on the saddle and beyond, we need to create and apply a repertoire of methods. These methods do not have to be completely new, as Shaw and Hesse [in @spinney2011] state; we only have to tweak "particular methods capable of harnessing the power of existing methodologies in mobile situations" (p. 164). 

My research contributed to such a repertoire of methods: I created a way to convey the sense of 'feeling there' as part of a temporary, random vélomobile formation-in-action in my pilot experiment. With the mobile soundscapes, I explored the role that audio can play in representing a bicycling experience. Using a map and an existing data set, I identified hot spots for interaction, which may serve as a starting point for further research. And through my videography, I found ways to research bicycle-based interaction in a more contextual and reflective way than conventional ethnography does. In addition to these experimental methods, I contributed a set of artefacts --- the representations resulted from my experiments.

Interaction designers can not only benefit from these methods by applying them in their own research; they can also contribute by extending the methodological repertoire. More sophisticated technology makes it easier and easier to capture and represent experiences. In a recent paper, Spinney discusses how bio-sensing techniques can help to apprehend the sensory, emotive and affective aspects of movement --- as complement to ride-alongs [-@spinney2015]. Besides vision and hearing, our other senses play a role in the bicycling experience as well; and reaching beyond the sensory, we can explore anger, pain, pleasure and other emotions. Lastly, with the rise of the so-called Internet of Things, we can employ research technology and intelligence on a scale that was impossible before, and investigate systems that go far beyond the single human being.

Mobility is always changing; I am excited to see what interaction designers will contribute to its study and practice in the future.
