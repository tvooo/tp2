# Workshops and design experiments {#experiments}

This chapter describes the different workshops and experiments that I conducted in the course of this project. Due to the explorative nature of my design process, the chapter's five sections do not represent my activities in chronological order:

To get a first impression of the design space, I executed the *pilot experiment* before the actual thesis work started. Subsequently, I conducted the *workshop* to learn more about the bicycling community in Malm√∂. However, the three *main experiments* --- although numbered 1--3 --- had not been executed in this order, nor did one experiment lead to another. They all explore methodology for doing bicycle-based interaction research through different aspects: soundscapes, mapping, and videography.
