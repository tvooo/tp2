# Methodology

\todo

This section briefly argues for the methodology used in this research project.

- Why no ethnographic studies?
- Mapping the design space (using existing exemplars) and identifying gaps ('design space' paper by Westerlund)
- The "What do prototypes prototype?" model
- design experiments all the way (Agger-Eriksen)

My research will be an exploration into the possibilities this phenomenon affords and can be distilled into two major questions:

1. How can we design for social interaction to take place during random encounters of bicyclists in vélomobile formations-in-action? How can this (neutral) randomness be turned into (pleasant) serendipity?
2. How can random vélomobile formations-in-action be constructively presented in order to convey a richer account of their experience?
